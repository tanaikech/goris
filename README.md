# Overview

This is a CLI tool to search for images with **Go**ogle **R**everse **I**mage **S**earch.

# Description

Images can be searched by image files and image URLs. Searched images display URLs and also can be downloaded as image files.

# How to Install

Download an executable file from [the release page](https://github.com/tanaikech/goris/releases) and put to a directory with path.

or

Use go get.

```bash
go install github.com/tanaikech/goris@latest
```

# IMPORTANT
20230406: In the current stage, the specification for running the reverse image search was changed at Google side. I could modify the script for searching the images using an image URL. But, I have still not modified the script for searching the images using an image file. I'm sorry for this. Now, I am analyzing. When I could do it, I would like to modify this. So, in the current stage, please use the following command.

```bash
goris s -u [image URL]
```

# Usage

Search images from an image file. You can select number of output URLs using `-n`. The maximum number of output URLs is 100. (The current default value is 10. So when `-n` is not used, 10 URLs are returned.)

```bash
goris s -f [image file] -n 50
```

Search images from an image URL.

```bash
goris s -u [image URL]
```

A simlpe test is as follows.

```bash
goris s -u https://stackoverflow.design/assets/img/logos/so/logo-stackoverflow.png
```

Download searched images from an image file. Following sample downloads 10 searched images using an image file.

```bash
goris s -f [image file] -d -n 10
```

Retrieve web pages with matching images on Google top page. When this is not used, images are retrieved.

```bash
goris s -u [image URL] -w
```

```bash
goris s -f [image file] -w
```

  Initial release.

- v1.0.1 (May 16, 2017)

  1. A bugfix

  1. Add option
     - When images are matched to a searched image, web pages with matching images are retrieved. These are web pages displayed on Google top page. When this is not used, images are retrieved. This was added as a boolean option. (This was added by a request.)

- v1.1.1 (January 3, 2020)

  1. It seems that the specification of `github.com/urfave/cli` was changed by the update of [https://github.com/urfave/cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli). By this, when `go get -u github.com/tanaikech/goris` is run, an error occurred. So this error was removed.

<a name="v200"></a>

- v2.0.0 (April 23, 2020)

- v3.0.4 (April 6, 2023)

  1. The specification for running the reverse image search was changed at Google side. By this, this application was also changed.

So, in the current stage, please use the following command.

	```bash
	goris s -u URL
	```
